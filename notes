Each unique color resides in one pixel/cell
Each color is pulled towards colors based on similarity
    - Pushed from colors that aren't similar?

Compute potential at each point
Swap two cells if doing so lowers overall potential


Potential shader 3 color
in: r[n*n], g[n*n], b[n*n]
out: rOut, gOut, bOut

Potential shader (once per color)
